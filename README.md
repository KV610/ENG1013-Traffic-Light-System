## Usage
Click **Add file** then **Upload files** and upload your edited code.

Add the version name in the commit header, and a reasonable description of what changes have been made in the file in the commit description. This will prevent confusion for others who are working on the code. 

> [!WARNING]  
> If the code is unstable/WIP please make sure you are on the `review` branch and commit there instead. If not, commit the change to the `main` branch.

You can view version history of a file by clicking on the file, and then clicking **History** underneath the three dots on the top right of the page.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please make sure the file you're uploading shares the same name as the one you wish to update, as version history requires the same file name.
